# Hello-World
First GitHub repository
I'm Greg, a python beginner, just trying to expand my skillset to work with data. Love board games and video games, so the goal is to work on some sort of AI or machine learning code in the future.
This is going to be a place for the self-inspired projects. Usually silly things, just to prove that I can.
